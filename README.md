# Hey there! My name is Drew Verwiel 👋

I'm an experienced web developer with a passion for creating awesome experiences. I have professional experience spanning React, Node, Sass, and MySQL. 
I've also spent some time with Next.js, Python, and GraphQL in my personal projects.

Believe it or not, I didn't start my journey as a coder. My background was in business, but I couldn't resist the allure of coding. So, I took a leap of faith and dove into the tech world to follow my true passion. Best decision ever!

I'm originally from Wisconsin, but these days, you'll find me chilling in Salt Lake City, surrounded by awesome landscapes! 🏞️ When I'm not coding, I'm all about arts, music, the great outdoors, and brewing up some tasty homebrews. 🍻 Each passion adds a spark to my life and keeps the creative juices flowing. Let's team up, have a blast, and make some awesome stuff together! 🌟
